This is the repository for my project for CEN4930C, Seminar in Advanced Software Development Class. My project is collecting and analyzing stock data using an API and Python cloud automation.

This project utilizes the AlphaVantage API in a Python script to collect the closing prices of select stock tickers each day (excluding weekends). This script was deployed on PythonAnywhere to run automatically every day the market was open at 6PM EST for about a 60-day period, collected data was saved to a file. Data was also collected for the similar time period in 2023 using historical data from Nasdaq for comparison. After the data collection period ended charts were created using the collected data via `Matplotlib`.  Along with my presentation of my project setup and data collection/visualization I put together a small report comparing my data to the 2023 data.
